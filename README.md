# horiseon-refactor

## Description
Created a repo through Github and cloned it through terminal into my correct file. In the HTML I changed all the divs to the appropriate semantics. For every div tag changed I left a comment explaining my changes. After every section I worked on I performed a git add and git commit to save my work. I checked the order of my h tags to make sure they were in numerical order through out my HTML. I also added alts for all my images and icons to describe what they are displaying.

In CSS I made the appropriate changes to add or take out the classes or ids to read from my HTML. I combined multiple codes into one that had the same edits and that were in the same class or tag. For everything changed in CSS a comment was left to show my changes.
